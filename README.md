##  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
### In this project I have created Infrastructure as code using terraform, which automatically deploy the Wordpress application
###  And in AWS, I have used  RDS service for the relational database for Wordpress application.
###  We can  deploy the Wordpress as a container either on top of Minikube or EKS or Fargate service on AWS 
###  In this project I have deployed the Wordpress on Minikube 
### And this  Wordpress application is  accessible from the public world if deployed on AWS or through workstation if deployed on Minikube.

## What is Wordpress

### At its core, WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 37.6% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes – more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress.

### On a slightly more technical level, WordPress is an open-source content management system licensed under GPLv2, which means that anyone can use or modify the WordPress software for free. A content management system is basically a tool that makes it easy to manage important aspects of your website – like content – without needing to know anything about programming.

### The end result is that WordPress makes building a website accessible to anyone – even people who aren’t developers.

 ## What is AWS RDS 
 
 
 ### Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

### Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimized for memory, performance or I/O - and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. You can use the AWS Database Migration Service to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.
